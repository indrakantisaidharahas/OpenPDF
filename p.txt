so i want to make a pdf converter 
first things first 
pdfs are the msot irriatting things known to man kind
some are txt formatrt and some are image format 
so when some one gives me a odf first i need to find out whether i need to use ocr or i need to use pdf plumber 
thought this is snot a good solutions because many pdfs fall under the intermediate 
so i hae to apply both \
the problem is to determine the stcutire 
so i got the ocr now is to run it on a pdf 



so ihaave now methods to do ocr and cinvert pdf to  image 
but no use wiht that 
because a pdf is a miture f images and text 

how do i dela wiht such intermediace 
should i isolate the images 


yeah screw everyhtig 
first i thought abt is tesseract good 
so i wanted to test how goo it was so i made test .py file to test its accuracy 
the metrics were 
Average CER: 0.0025130318540632058
Average WER: 0.0016666666666666666
a good performance but we have fint limitations here 


so next i am thinking to proced wiht making the network here 
yeah so i was thinking if this were a commercila project would i need nginx 
but since this is nt commericil i will first gowiht a simpel server 
if i have abundance of time i will see th nginx 


i was thinking of integrating pyhon prcoes wiht nodejs sever
agin i have to think secuity also here
lol gotta be careful react 19 was hacked 


so firt i will deal wit compresing pdfs 

yeah what hosudl i d for nowl
